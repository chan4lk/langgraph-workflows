*   **2.2. Component Description:**

    *   **2.2.1. LangGraph Core:**
        LangGraph serves as the central orchestration engine for the workflow. It manages the state flow, node execution, and transitions based on the defined workflow graph. We utilize LangGraph's `StateGraph` to represent workflows, with nodes representing agents, functions, human tasks, sub-workflows, or control points, and edges defining the execution flow, including conditional and parallel paths. LangGraphâ€™s state management capabilities are crucial for tracking workflow progress and enabling agentic interactions, as well as managing the state across complex workflow structures. The choice of LangGraph is justified by its native support for building agentic workflows, its robust state management, and its flexibility in defining complex execution paths, now extended to handle advanced workflow patterns.

    *   **2.2.2. Pydantic Agents:**
        Agents are the intelligent actors within the workflow, built using Pydantic models. Pydantic is used to define the structure of agents, including their input/output schemas, configurations, and data validation. Agents are designed to be modular and reusable components. Different agent types can be defined based on their roles and capabilities (e.g., summarization agent, research agent, data analysis agent). Pydantic ensures data integrity and provides a clear interface for agent interaction within the LangGraph workflow.

    *   **2.2.3. MCP Server - Tool Execution:**
        The MCP (Model, Component, Protocol) Server is a dedicated service responsible for executing tools. This decouples tool execution from the core workflow engine, enhancing scalability, maintainability, and security.  Tools, including LangChain MCP Tools and custom tools, are exposed as network services via the MCP Server. Agents interact with tools by sending requests to the MCP Server API. This architecture allows for tools to be implemented in different languages if needed and managed independently.

    *   **2.2.4. Workflow Definition & Management:**
        Workflows are visually defined using the React Flow UI. The UI allows users to drag and drop nodes (agents, functions, start/end points, human tasks, sub-workflows), connect them with edges (default, conditional, fork, join), and configure node and edge properties. The React Flow UI generates a JSON representation of the workflow definition, which is then submitted to the backend API. Workflow definitions are versioned and managed, allowing users to create, edit, deploy, manage different workflow versions, and rollback to previous versions.

    *   **2.2.5. PostgreSQL for State and Checkpointing:**
        PostgreSQL is used as the persistent storage for workflow state, agent state, and checkpointing data. LangGraph's state object is serialized and stored in PostgreSQL after each node execution, ensuring workflow resilience and the ability to resume execution after interruptions. Checkpointing strategies are implemented to periodically save workflow progress, minimizing data loss in case of failures. PostgreSQL provides reliability, data integrity, and scalability for managing workflow state, now including more complex state structures to support advanced workflow features.

    *   **2.2.6. Execution Engine & Orchestration (LangGraph):**
        LangGraph orchestrates the workflow execution based on the defined StateGraph, now including support for Human Task Nodes, Sub-workflow Nodes, Conditional Edges, and Parallel Fork/Join Edges. The execution engine follows the edges, executes nodes in sequence or parallel, handles conditional branching logic, manages human task workflows, and orchestrates sub-workflow executions. Error handling and retry mechanisms are implemented within LangGraph to ensure robust workflow execution across these more complex workflow patterns. LangGraph's execution engine manages the flow of control, state updates, and interactions with Pydantic Agents, the MCP Server, and now also user interactions for human tasks and sub-workflow management.

    *   **2.2.7. React Flow-based Workflow Designer UI:**
        The React Flow UI provides a visual interface for users to design and manage workflows. Key features are extended to include:
        * Drag-and-drop node creation for Start, End, Agent, Function, Human Task, and Sub-workflow Nodes.
        * Edge creation for default, conditional, fork, and join edge types.
        * Node configuration panels for all node types, including specific configurations for Human Task Nodes (assignment, input fields) and Sub-workflow Nodes (workflow selection, parameter mapping).
        * Conditional Edge configuration panel for defining condition expressions.
        * Visual workflow layout and editing with enhanced visual cues for parallel and conditional flows.
        * Workflow saving, loading, version management, and rollback capabilities.
        * Real-time workflow monitoring and execution status (to be implemented - ongoing enhancement).
        * UI screens for managing LLM configurations, API definitions, Prompt Templates, Tools, and now also RBAC configurations.
        * Integrated UI for managing Human Tasks (or option for separate task UI).

    *   **2.2.8. Monitoring & Logging:**
        A comprehensive monitoring and logging system is integrated to track the health and performance of the workflow engine and individual workflows. Metrics to be tracked include workflow execution time, agent performance, tool execution times, error rates, system resource utilization, and now also metrics related to human task completion and sub-workflow execution. Logging is implemented at different levels to capture workflow execution details, agent actions, system events, and user interactions with human tasks. Monitoring and logging data are used for debugging, performance analysis, system health monitoring, and auditing workflow executions.

**3. Detailed Design**

*   **3.1. Pydantic Agent Design:**

    *   **3.1.1. Pydantic Agent Architecture:**
        Pydantic Agents are structured using Pydantic models to define their input and output schemas. An agent typically consists of:
        * **Input Model (Pydantic):** Defines the expected input data for the agent.
        * **Output Model (Pydantic):** Defines the structure of the agent's output data.
        * **Core Logic:** Python code that implements the agent's behavior, including:
            * Prompt construction using prompt templates.
            * LLM interaction using configured LLM settings.
            * Tool invocation via the MCP Server API.
            * Logic for processing inputs, interacting with tools, and generating outputs.
        * **Tool Retrieval Mechanism:**  Agents are configured with a list of allowed tools. The agent's logic determines when and how to use these tools.
        * **Prompt Templates:** Agents utilize pre-defined prompt templates to guide their interactions with LLMs.
        * **Agent Memory:** Mechanisms to retain conversation history and short-term memory within the agent's execution context.

    *   **3.1.2. Agent Capabilities & Roles:**
        Different agent types can be created with specific capabilities and roles within workflows. Examples include:
        * **Summarizer Agent:**  Responsible for summarizing text content.
        * **Research Agent:**  Conducts research using search tools and information retrieval tools.
        * **Data Analysis Agent:**  Analyzes data using data processing and analysis tools.
        * **Routing Agent:**  Makes decisions to route workflow execution based on conditions or data.
        * **Planning Agent:** Decomposes complex tasks and creates execution plans.
        Agent roles are defined by their specific logic, prompt templates, tools, and planning/memory capabilities.

    *   **3.1.3. Agent Lifecycle Management:**
        Agents are instantiated and initialized at the start of a workflow execution when an Agent Node is encountered in LangGraph. Agents are active during the execution of their assigned node and are terminated or become idle after completing their task and transitioning to the next node. Agent state, including memory, can be persisted in PostgreSQL if needed for more complex agent behaviors.

    *   **3.1.4. Agent Security & Permissions:**
        Agent security is primarily managed through tool access control, RBAC, and data privacy considerations. Agents are only granted access to tools that are explicitly configured for them in their definition and controlled by RBAC policies. Data privacy is ensured by adhering to data handling best practices within agent logic and ensuring secure communication channels (HTTPS) for MCP Server interactions. RBAC further restricts access to agent configurations and workflow definitions based on user roles.

*   **3.2. Workflow Definition Language (React Flow Driven):**

    *   **3.2.1. Syntax and Semantics:**
        Workflows are defined in JSON format, generated from the React Flow UI. The JSON structure is extended to include new node and edge types and their specific configurations:
        * **`nodes` array:** Defines nodes in the workflow, including their `id`, `type` (`start`, `agent`, `function`, `end`, `human_task`, `sub_workflow`), `position` for UI layout, and `data` for node-specific configurations.
        * **`edges` array:** Defines connections between nodes, including `id`, `source` node `id`, `target` node `id`, `type` (`default`, `conditional`, `fork`, `join`), and `data` for edge-specific configurations (e.g., condition expression for `conditional` edges).
        The `data` section in nodes is extended for new node types:
        * **Agent Node Data:** `agentName`, `llmConfigId`, `promptTemplateId`, `tools` (array of tool IDs).
        * **Function Node Data:** `functionName`, `description`, `promptTemplateId`.
        * **Start/End Node Data:** `label`.
        * **Human Task Node Data:** `taskName`, `description`, `assignmentRules` (users/groups), `inputFields` (definition of user input fields).
        * **Sub-workflow Node Data:** `workflowId` (reference to sub-workflow definition), `parameterMapping` (mapping of parent workflow state to sub-workflow input).
        * **Conditional Edge Data:** `conditionExpression` (string representing the condition to evaluate).

    *   **3.2.2. Workflow Validation & Error Handling:**
        Workflow definitions validation is extended to cover new node and edge types and their configurations. Server-side validation now includes:
        * Validation of Human Task Node configurations (assignment rules, input field definitions).
        * Validation of Sub-workflow Node configurations (workflow ID existence, parameter mapping correctness).
        * Validation of Conditional Edge condition expressions (syntax checking, potential security analysis).
        * Cycle detection in workflows, now considering all edge types.
        Error handling during workflow definition and parsing provides detailed error messages in the UI, pinpointing issues in node/edge configurations and workflow structure.

*   **3.3. PostgreSQL State Management Details:**

    *   **3.3.1. PostgreSQL Schema for State and Checkpoints:**
        PostgreSQL schema is extended to include tables for RBAC and potentially enhanced workflow versioning data if needed. Existing tables are adapted to store data for new node and edge types, such as Human Task configurations, Sub-workflow references, and Conditional Edge conditions.

    *   **3.3.2. State Transitions & Updates (Postgres):**
        State transitions and updates in PostgreSQL are extended to manage state for more complex workflows with parallel branches, human tasks, and sub-workflows. State persistence mechanisms are adapted to handle potential concurrent state updates from parallel execution paths and ensure data consistency across all workflow features.

    *   **3.3.3. Checkpointing Strategy (Postgres):**
        Checkpointing strategy is reviewed and potentially enhanced to ensure effective recovery for workflows with human tasks, sub-workflows, and parallel execution. Checkpoint frequency and granularity might be adjusted based on the complexity and criticality of different workflow types. Checkpoints will include sufficient information to restore the state of parallel branches and pending human tasks.

*   **3.4. MCP Tooling & Integration Details:**

    *   **3.4.1. Tool Interface & Abstraction (MCP):**
        The MCP Server exposes tools via a REST API. Each tool is represented by a dedicated endpoint on the MCP Server. The interface for each tool is defined by its request and response JSON schemas. The workflow engine interacts with tools by sending HTTP POST requests to the MCP Server endpoints with tool-specific parameters in the request body and receiving JSON responses as tool outputs.

    *   **3.4.2. Tool Registry & Discovery (MCP Server):**
        The MCP Server maintains a registry of available tools and their endpoints. Tool definitions, including endpoint paths, request/response schemas, and descriptions, are configured and managed within the MCP Server. The workflow engine discovers and uses tools based on the tool definitions configured in the "Tools" screen and stored in the `tools` table in PostgreSQL.

    *   **3.4.3. Tool Security & Access Control (MCP Server):**
        Tool security and access control via the MCP Server are reinforced by RBAC. Tool access permissions can be defined and managed through the RBAC system, ensuring that only authorized agents and workflows can utilize specific tools. MCP Server authentication and authorization mechanisms are integrated with the RBAC system.

*   **3.5. Execution Flow & Orchestration Logic (LangGraph):**

    *   **3.5.1. Node Execution Logic (LangGraph with Pydantic Agents & MCP Tools):**
        * **Start Node:** Marks the entry point of the workflow. No specific execution logic.
        * **Agent Node:**
            1. LangGraph invokes the agent node function.
            2. The agent node function retrieves the Pydantic Agent instance based on the workflow configuration.
            3. The agent constructs a prompt using the configured prompt template and current workflow state.
            4. The agent interacts with the configured LLM (using the specified LLM configuration).
            5. If the agent needs to use tools, it invokes the `invoke_mcp_server_tool` function.
            6. The agent processes the LLM response and tool outputs.
            7. The agent updates the workflow state with its output, including agent memory updates if applicable.
            8. LangGraph proceeds to the next node based on the edges.
        * **Function Node:**
            1. LangGraph invokes the function node function.
            2. The function node function retrieves the prompt template (if configured).
            3. It may interact with the MCP Server to use tools.
            4. It performs its defined logic (prompt-driven).
            5. It updates the workflow state with its output.
            6. LangGraph proceeds to the next node.
        * **End Node:** Marks the end of the workflow. No specific execution logic.
        * **Human Task Node:**
            1. LangGraph encounters a Human Task Node.
            2. The workflow execution pauses at this node.
            3. A task is created and assigned to a designated user or user group (based on configuration).
            4. A notification is sent to the assigned user(s).
            5. The user interacts with a task UI.
            6. The user provides input data and completes/approves the task.
            7. Upon task completion, the workflow execution resumes from the Human Task Node, using the user-provided input data as part of the workflow state.
        * **Sub-workflow Node:**
            1. LangGraph encounters a Sub-workflow Node.
            2. The Sub-workflow Node references another workflow definition.
            3. LangGraph initiates execution of the referenced sub-workflow as a child process of the current workflow.
            4. Input data can be passed from the parent workflow state to the sub-workflow as initial state.
            5. The sub-workflow executes independently.
            6. Upon completion of the sub-workflow, its output state is returned to the parent workflow and merged into the parent workflow's state.
            7. The parent workflow execution continues from the Sub-workflow Node.

    *   **3.5.2. Edge Traversal & Condition Evaluation (LangGraph):**
        * **Default Edges:** Sequential flow to the target node.
        * **Conditional Edges:**
            1. Condition expression is evaluated against the current workflow state.
            2. If the condition is `true`, the edge is traversed to the target node.
            3. Only the first conditional edge with a `true` condition is traversed (for mutually exclusive conditions).
        * **Parallel Fork/Join Edges:**
            * **Fork Edge:** Initiates parallel execution branches. Workflow execution splits into multiple paths.
            * **Join Edge:** Merges parallel execution branches. Waits for all incoming branches to complete before proceeding.

    *   **3.5.3. Workflow Execution Engine Algorithm (LangGraph):**
        The LangGraph execution engine orchestrates workflows with advanced features:
            1. Start execution at the designated Start Node.
            2. Execute the current node's function based on its type (Agent, Function, End, Human Task, Sub-workflow).
            3. Update the workflow state in PostgreSQL after node execution.
            4. Determine the next node(s) based on outgoing edge types (Default, Conditional, Fork, Join) and evaluate conditions for Conditional Edges.
            5. Manage parallel execution branches concurrently for Fork/Join patterns.
            6. Handle error conditions and retries for all node types.
            7. Repeat steps 2-6 until all execution paths reach End Nodes or the workflow is terminated.

    *   **3.5.6. Parallel Execution Management:**
        LangGraph manages parallel execution branches using asynchronous task queues or threading/asyncio. State management is designed to handle concurrent state updates and merge states at Join Nodes, ensuring data consistency in parallel workflows.

*   **3.6. React Flow UI Design:**

    *   **3.6.1. React Flow Components and Features:**
        * **Custom Nodes:** Components for Start Node, End Node, Agent Node, Function Node, Human Task Node, Sub-workflow Node.
        * **Edge Types:** `default`, `conditional`, `fork`, `join` edges with visual distinctions.
        * **Node Drag and Drop, Zoom and Pan, Node Context Menus, Edge Interaction, Workflow Canvas:** Standard React Flow UI features for visual workflow design.
        * **Properties Panel:** Dynamic sidebar for configuring node properties, including specific panels for Human Task Nodes (assignment, input fields), Sub-workflow Nodes (workflow selection, parameter mapping), and Conditional Edges (condition expression editor).

    *   **3.6.2. UI Workflow for Workflow Creation & Management:**
        Users can:
        1. Create new workflows on a blank canvas.

        5. Save, load, execute, version, and rollback workflows.
        6. Manage workflows in a list view.

    *   **3.6.5. Human Task UI:**
        Human Task UI is integrated within the React Flow UI, featuring:
        * A dedicated section to display assigned human tasks.
        * Task lists showing task details and status.
